# Sibelius Plugins

Sibelius Plugins are ways to extend the abilities of Sibelius. There are many [extra plugins available](https://www.sibelius.com/download/plugins/index.html).
The ones in this repo were created by me to assist in accessibility as well as general functionality. The plugins are written in Sibelius'[ManuScript Language](https://resources.avid.com/SupportFiles/Sibelius/2022.3/ManuScript_Language_Guide.pdf). 
and many were built by [Bob Zawalich](https://bobzawalich.com/sibelius/).

A couple of super useful ones I use from him are 
1. [Exchange Staff Contents](https://sibelius.com/download/plugins/index.html?plugin=143)
2. [Edit Instrument Names](https://www.sibelius.com/download/plugins/index.html?plugin=71).
#### (Always remember to setup keyboard shortcuts!)

## [General Installation Instructions](https://www.sibelius.com/download/plugins/index.html?help=install)
#### Plugins are most easily installed from within Sibelius, under `File>Plugins`
#### To install the plugins in this repo:
 1. download the .txt file in one of the above folders

## Plugin Details
### Go To Start
Returns the selector to the beginning of the score.  
This is a very frequent action that normally requires many keystrokes or mouse gestures.  
I usually assign the `~` key to it to quickly go bac to the top.

### Move Selection to Playback Line
When listening back to a score, sometimes its convenient to stop and immediately edit something.  
This plugin will bring the selector to the proximity of the playback line.  
I like to assign this to `\`

### Print Cue Sheet
Prints out a list of score information that includes Key Changes, Tempos, Rehearsal Markings, and Measure Numbers  
Copy and Paste wherever you might need it.

### Staff Volumes
Hey Sibelius! Your Mixer is totally inaccessible.  
This plugin opens a dialogue with instrument names and Staff Volumes as editable numbers.
